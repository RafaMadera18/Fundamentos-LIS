Begin: November 3rd, 2022
Ended:  November 10th, 2022

In this sprint we worked on the user story "choose a soft skill” and its certain acceptance criteria, the story mentions that the user wants to choose the soft skill which he wants to learn, however we didn't have the soft-skills at the time, so it wouldn't allow them to choose, that's why, for strategic reasons, we decided to do two parallel sprints in which we'll be working on the same user story, this time, with different content.

We decided which soft skills will be on the prototype, we discussed the options and finally decided that we would work on “creativity” and “decision making”, then we divided the team into 2 groups of threesomes and each group would investigate their soft skill and would develop their activities. We developed the activities with the support of reliable sources and included them in the prototype, resulting in our prototype number 2.0:
