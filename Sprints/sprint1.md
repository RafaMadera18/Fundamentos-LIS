The activity carried out was the improvement of the prototype, this time taking into account these three user stories and their acceptance criteria, in this sprint the entire team was included, elements were added to the first interface, which could help to accomplish the necessary characteristics, such as a box to mark the activity as done, as well as elements that would allow the identification of the user's progress (the activities carried out), in addition to explicitly observing the freedom that the user has, to access all the activities, even if these have already been previously completed, fulfilling with the user story.
