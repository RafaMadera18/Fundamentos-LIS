## Our project proposal

Subject asistant: https://youtu.be/isviSnnD40g

There are about **126 optional subjects** you can choose from when loading them at the beginning of each semester. This is without a doubt an overwhelming number of options that make it very difficult to decide properly in the short amount of time you must do so.
On top of that, the [SICEI](https://www.sicei.uady.mx/) platform has some technical and issues that add yet another layer of complexity to an already hard and tedious process. For example, some issues the team encountered while using the platform are:
- Every time you resize any item (to be able to read the full texts that are usually cut off by other items) it will snap you back to the top of the page, making it very annoying and time consuming to read the full descriptions of every subject and analyze whether you are interested in it or not.
- Another issue with selecting optional subjects is the fact that the names are sometimes way to elaborate and don’t really tell you what the subject is about unless you read the 1-2 paragraph description (which doesn’t sound that bad, but the number of available subjects turns it into a long and tedious process).
- There is also no way to sort the subjects depending on your interests or their compatibility with your schedule, making it so you must read all 126 descriptions if you want to make sure you are not missing any you might want to take.
