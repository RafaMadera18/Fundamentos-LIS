There are about **126 optional subjects** you can choose from when loading them at the beginning of each semester. This is without a doubt an overwhelming number of options that make it very difficult to decide properly in the short amount of time you must do so.
On top of that, the [SICEI](https://www.sicei.uady.mx/) platform has some technical and issues that add yet another layer of complexity to an already hard and tedious process. For example, some issues the team encountered while using the platform are:

- Every time you resize any item (to be able to read the full texts that are usually cut off by other items) it will snap you back to the top of the page, making it very annoying and time consuming to read the full descriptions of every subject and analyze whether you are interested in it or not.

- Names are sometimes way to elaborate and don’t really tell you what the subject is about unless you read the 1-2 paragraph description (which doesn’t sound that bad, but the number of available subjects turns it into a long and tedious process).

- There is also no way to sort the subjects depending on your interests or their compatibility with your schedule, making it so you must read all 126 descriptions if you want to make sure you are not missing any you might want to take.

---

There are many existing options, and if we don't know how to make good decisions, we would be losing the opportunity to learn something that we may really like or need in the future.

No one wants to choose their non-compulsory subjects wrongly, credits are important, but just as important is our learning.

And that's why this project was born, **Subject Assistant** is an open-source app that has the purpose of aid UADY students to choose their non-compulsory subjects, this based on various data provided by the user such as:

- Regular class schedules.
- Preferences for certain areas.
- Credits value.
- Preferred schedules or teachers.
- Etcetera.

An algorithm will process all data and sort all subjects offered starting with the most desirable ones, which will be graphically displayed by the app.
All this with the purpose of facilitating this (otherwise long and tedious) process for the students and helping them to make informed decisions.
