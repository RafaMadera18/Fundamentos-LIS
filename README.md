### Product evolution:

In this second delivery, we focused on designing the product, but before building the wireframe we had to restructure and refine the requirements to continue with the following steps. Later on, having our products’ wireframe, the next we needed to do was make it into a medium-fidelity prototype, in which we added the different available soft skills with their respective activities.

The products’ general objective is still very similar to what it was in the first increment of the project, but we now have a much more detailed specification of exactly what it is and how it’s going to achieve the goals we have in mind.

We decided to focus on only two softskills, these being creativity and decision making. This decision was made because limiting us to only two soft skills will allow us to develop higher quality study plans and activities for each one, and by the end of the project we will have a sturdy base from which we could continue adding content to the project.

We also decided that the best platform for our project would be a mobile app, this way it’s a lot easier for us to distribute it and for people to get started using it. It also gives us a lot of freedom in the way we design our activities.

There was also a reduction in the number of features we had originally planned, we eliminated periodic evaluations and the progression system because they didn’t add much value to the project and would have made development a lot more complex. 

### Requeriments:

#### Requeriments evolution:

Here you can see our [old requeriments](Artifacts/Table%20of%20requirements%20OLD.pdf)
and our [new requeriments](Artifacts/Table%20of%20requirements%20NEW.pdf).

The requirements had a rewrite since the first increment, we realized our requirements list had a lot of redundancies, some of them were poorly written and most of the requirements explained how we planned to build the app before having established the design. We reduced the list of requirements to the core five that explain what we want to achieve with our project.

### Process managment:

The process management that this work implied left us with a series of artifacts.
The first artifact is the [contribution metric](Activity%20scores/Contribution%20metric-Unit%202.pdf), this allows us to realize that we actually do a collaborative work, since there are activities in which was involved all the team, this don't reduce agility, but, made us achieve the activities on the set time, also are activities that we did individually, every activity has a score assigned previously agreed with the team, so everyone was agree with the score, which allowed the realization of a just work, resulting in all had the same score.

A tool that we use to organize ourselves was [trello](https://trello.com/b/JzEzsDt0/our-project-fis), in which we can observe those responsible for assigned each task to them, as well as the delivery deadline, worth mentioning that in the Trello can also find activities that we did as a team witch aren't accurately from this project, but yes from the rest of the class, this is important to mention it as allows us to visualize that each activity was previously design and was a monitoring to secure the developing of each activities required.
  
The last artifact of the management of the process was the [binacle from this second part](Binnacle/binnacle2.md), its importance is that thanks to this we could have the control and report of what was done during the weak, here we can observe the agreements we reached, and what we did before, during and after each meeting.

### Design:

#### Prototypes:

The [prototype made](https://www.figma.com/file/e2DL72NnvbuJVVrgAsR9KM/AdAstra-Prototype?t=MR2w50zqbj4Qz0l9-1) is of medium fidelity and was made on [Figma](https://www.figma.com).

In terms of how we organized content, we took inspiration from existing apps that feature content or activities similar to what we've planned, in which we analyzed what worked and what seemed to us to be deficient within these apps.

We tried to keep the interface clean and simple by not presenting the user with many options at once and allowing them to move freely between the available screens.

To design the color palette, the [Adobe Colors](https://color.adobe.com/es/create/color-wheel) tool was used.

#### Correspondence with the Requirements:

After reworking the requirements, the user stories, and establishing the acceptance criteria, we considered that they were specific enough and we could start carrying out the interface tests.

1. Choose a soft-skill:

After the first welcome menu, the first thing that follows is the skills catalog, where the user can select the desired soft-skill to train.

2. Progress recognition:

In the acceptance criteria of this requirement, we had established that each activity had to have a checkbox to be marked by the user, and when they moved between menus its status would remain intact, that is, whether they were already completed or not.

3. Completed content:

After selecting the skill, a menu is presented where a vertical list of activities is presented and the user can access the one they want, even if they have already completed it. In the acceptance criteria for this, we established that the list of activities will always be the same, that is, they will be presented in the same order.

4. Soft-skills categorization:

Related to the first requirement of how we structure the content by skill and from there by activity. Likewise, in the acceptance criteria of this we include that the interface must be accompanied by a representative illustration of the skill.

5. Progress saving:

This is a slightly more technical requirement, which could not be implemented due to limitations of the platform where the prototype was made, but by the time we are in the implementation phase, the current design will not generate problems with this requirement and it will be possible to implement.

#### Interfaces validation:

The prototype of the medium-fidelity interface (made on the Figma) was presented to the target customers, which are university-level students.

* Simulation of specific tasks to allow a better validation of the interface:

1. Users were told to navigate from the app home to a certain activity, for example, “Go activity number 3 of the Creativity skill”. This to validate that the interface is intuitive and easily understood by users who have never had contact with the app.

2. Users were instructed to follow a list of slightly more complex navigation instructions, for example, “Go activity number 2 of the decision-making skill, mark this as completed, using the navigation arrows go to the activity number 5 of this same skill, using the home button go to the skill selection menu, finally go to the first activity of the creativity skill and mark it as completed”. This is to verify that users understand and are easily orient themselves in the application menus.

3. Users were instructed to freely explore the application and further analyze the content of the activities, then they were asked if the wording seemed clear and they fully understood what would be done in the activities.

4. Finally, they were asked:

¬ Did you find the interface intuitive?
¬ What would you modify or add?

* Results:

It was observed that the users had no problems navigating and understanding the structure of the interface (even if it was their first contact with it), since they were able to follow the navigation instructions perfectly, for this reason, it is considered unnecessary to implement a help section where this would be described.

* Collection of comments and corresponding changes.

The users found the content of the activities understandable and interesting, and they also mentioned that they did find the navigation and structuring of the content intuitive.

\- Feedback:
* Too much text density in some areas.
* Lack of graphic elements.
* The color of certain texts makes it difficult to read.

\- Changes:
* Indentation was added to paragraphs.
* The paragraphs were better distributed.
* Long activities were organized into pages.
* Changed the color of some texts.
* Graphic elements were added.

### Generic skills:

  •	**Communicates in Spanish orally and in writing in his professional interventions and his personal life using the language correctly**
  
Communication is extremely important in our day-to-day and we obtained this competence while restructuring and refining the requirements, also in the meetings between the development team and the scrum master, as well while creating the work material for the soft skills, since in each of these activities we had to express ourselves clearly and concisely to avoid misunderstandings and make others understand what we want to communicate.

  •	**Uses ICT in their professional interventions and their personal life in a pertinent and responsible manner.**
  
For this second increment, we continue using Trello to be able to organize ourselves and assign tasks, Github to store the information in our repository, and Teams to hold meetings and discuss what we should do next.
But unlike the last increment, we learned to use Figma to be able to translate our wireframe into a medium-fidelity prototype.

  •	**Make decisions in your professional and personal practice, responsibly.**
  
We had an organized list of activities so that we could be prepared and move forward using our developed skills. As a team, we decided to prioritize the design and test phases of the project.

### Disciplinary skills:

  •	**Select the Software Life Cycle Model at the beginning of a project, based on the characteristics of the development team, the client, and the problem.**

This competence was obtained no long after the first delivery of the project, after we analyzed and compared the different life cycle models, we went on and selected the prototype model. This model was the one we considered to be the most suitable for our project, since it´s currently being developed as a mobile application, working with prototypes will benefit the development team, as well as the client.

We also had to prepare an exposition about the prototype model, including and example of how it was used during the development of a project. Doing this helped us to better understand the model we choose and made us realize that it was the model that would best suit our project.
