### Description:

The product’s main objective is to help the user to train and polish the softskills they might need due to their line of work. Having as well, the opportunity to check on other softskills that could be useful for them at some point. The user will train the softskills they selected, by completing certain activities, such as riddles and exercises, as well as watching videos related to the softskill they´re training. 

The project´s reach we have in mind, is based on the assistance we are providing to the user, by helping them develop new softskills or train and polish the ones they already have knowledge of. Besides that, since the project will initially be focusing on English language speakers, the reach will be larger, than starting with the project being on Spanish, and it will also increase the number of potential users we might have in the future.

At the moment, we will be focusing only on two softskills, to begin with, since there are plenty of available softskills we could use, and it would take us a long time to finish the project, time we don’t really have. So, time will be our main limitation while developing the project.


### Users:

We are focused on helping all kind of peolple who wants to learn or improve their softskills. Our main users are student from various 
semesters that want to have a complete scolar education cause since they will need it in their day to day.

### Process description:

We adopted the SCRUM methodology for the development of our project. This methodology is based on assigning a “Scrum master”, who is the person in charge of managing the time and resources available for the project, and a “Development team”, which is the group of people managed by the Scrum master to develop the product. 
In our case, the “Scrum master” would be Russel Bonilla Pech, and the “Development team” the rest of the group.
An important characteristic of this methodology is the fact that even though there are roles assigned, it allows for change and variations on the functions performed by the team members if the project requires it.
The scrum methodology also allows for a role called “Product owner”. He works with the primary users and the scrum team to make sure the final product is aligned with the requirements and the commercial objectives. Since our project doesn’t have commercial objectives, the role of the “Product owner” isn’t clearly defined, however, the role teacher Edgar Cambranes fulfills, is very similar, because he corrects the mistakes and advises the team on how to better achieve the set objectives.
To start the project, we first defined the “Product backlog”, meaning we made a list of ideas, necessities, etc. which we discussed in a “Sprint planning meeting” where we stablished our “Sprint backlog” which is the group of requirements needed to build a set part of the project in a certain time span (Usually, 4 weeks according to the SCRUM methodology)
Another important part of SCRUM we adopted is the “Daily scrum” which are daily meetings to solve any organizational issues and get up to date on the work being done. The only difference being we hold the meetings only twice a week (one with the teacher and one without him). To speed up the process we write down on a binnacle the previously done activities, the problems that came up and what we plan on working on next.
Finally, we also use a Trello board in which we define and assign the specific activities for every team member, this way everyone can easily check the development status and their assigned tasks at any moment.

### Process managment:
La gestión de procesos es éste trabajo implico nos dejo una serie de artefactos, como bien habéamos mencionado, una herramienta que nos sirvió para organizarnos fue trello (https://trello.com/invite/b/JzEzsDt0/82622df015db673c01da3dc87a92871d/our-project-fis), mientras que, lo que nos permitió monitorear que cada integrante cumpla con su parte del trabajo fue GitHub, además, con éste documento podemos observar los valores dados a cada actividad, valores llegados de la forma más objetiva posible, es decir con un acuerdo entre todo el equipo.
Con los brancch de GitHub podemos observar que cada integrante aportó una parte escencial al proyecto, es decir para monitorear el cumplimiento de sus actividades cada integrante tien su propio branch donde agregó su parte.

Las bitácoras se encuentran en éste mismo GitHub (incluir enlace), en las cuáles podemos observar los
acuerdos, lo trabajado en cada/resolución de conflictos...
la herramienta de monitoreo utilizada fue github, ya que cada quién tiene su branch y para dar un seguimiento y asignar las tareas utilizamos trello, en el cual pusimos las fechas de inicio y fechas límite de entrega... los productos resultantes se pueden encontrar en éste github...

(Se incluyen las actividades/tareas/herramientas de monitoreo y/o seguimiento. Se cuentan con bitácoras de las reuniones donde se pueden observar los
acuerdos/resolución de conflictos, tareas, responsables, productos resultantes y fechas límite de entrega. )
