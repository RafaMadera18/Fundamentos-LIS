### Product evoution:

In this second delivery, we focused on designing the product, but before building the wireframe we had to restructure and refine the requirements to continue with the following steps. Later on, having our products´ wireframe, the next we needed to do was make it into a medium-fidelity prototype, in which we added the different available soft skills with their respective activities.
Finally, we did a test with different users to check out how they interact with the prototype and to know if we had something to change about the interface or the wording of the activities.

### Requeriments:

#### Requeriments evolution:

Puedes hacer una comparación entre los requerimientos así cóm justificar el motivo de cambio, (por cuestiones de tiempo, porque elegimos los más esenciales, etc...)

#### Refinement of artifacts:

podemos dar una breve explicación de los cambios, por ejemplo, no utilizamos los diagramas de casos de uso e hicimos algunos cambios en las h. de usuario de acuerdo a nuestros requerimientos.....

[Sprint 5](...)

### Process managment:

The process management that this work implied left us with a series of artifacts.
The first artifact is the [contribution metric](https://github.com/RaptorRush135/Fundamentos-LIS/blob/Russel-Adrian-Bonilla-Pech-Entrega-1/Activity%20scores/Contribution%20metric-Unit%202.pdf), this allows us to realize that we actually do a collaborative work, since there are activities in which was involved all the team, this don't reduce agility, but, made us achieve the activities on the set time, also are activities that we did individually, every activity has a score assigned previously agreed with the team, so everyone was agree with the score, which allowed the realization of a just work, resulting in all had the same score.

A tool that we use to organize ourselves was
[trello](https://trello.com/b/JzEzsDt0/our-project-fis), in which we can observe those responsible for assigned each task to them, as well as the delivery deadline, worth mentioning that in the Trello can also find activities that we did as a team witch aren't accurately from this project, but yes from the rest of the class, this is important to mention it as allows us to visualize that each activity was previously design and was a monitoring to secure the developing of each activities required
  
The last artifact of the management of the process was the [binacle from this second part](https://github.com/RaptorRush135/Fundamentos-LIS/blob/Russel-Adrian-Bonilla-Pech-Entrega-1/Binnacle/binnacle2.md), its importance is that thanks to this we could have the control and report of what was done during the weak, here we can observe the agreements we reached, and what we did before, during and after each meeting.

### Design:

#### Prototypes:

agregar prototipos, recomendación, agregar las capturas en un md dentro de una carpeta y poner el link

#### ¿corresponde con los requerimientos? ¿por qué?:

For the design of the product, we have some requirements which are reflected in the creation of the prototype. First, any user after entering the application can choose between any available soft skills they wish to develop, in this case, we have two: creativity and decision-making. And when they choose one of the soft skills, the list of activities for each skill will appear.
Our next requirement is recognition of progress. Each time the user completes an activity, they can mark the task as completed in the box that appears at the top right of the screen, so they can know which activities have already been done and which remain to be completed. Moving on to the next point, once the activity is finished, the user can review the activity and its content again using the arrows located at the bottom of the screen or return to the list of all activities and select the one they want to review.


#### validación de las interfaces con el cliente / usuarios:

### Our presentation video (delivery 2):


### Generic skills:
#### -Communicates in Spanish orally and in writing in his professional interventions and his personal life using the language correctly
Communication is extremely important in our day-to-day and we obtained this competence while restructuring and refining the requirements, also in the meetings between the development team and the scrum master, as well while creating the work material for the soft skills, since in each of these activities we had to express ourselves clearly and concisely to avoid misunderstandings and make others understand what we want to communicate.
#### -Uses ICT in their professional interventions and their personal life in a pertinent and responsible manner
For this second delivery, we continue using Trello to be able to organize ourselves and assign tasks, Github to store the information in our repository, and Teams to hold meetings and discuss what we should do next.
But unlike the last installment, we learned to use Figma to be able to translate our wireframe into a medium-fidelity prototype.
#### -Make decisions in your professional and personal practice, responsibly.
We had an organized list of activities so that we could be prepared and move forward using our developed skills. As a team, we decided to prioritize the design and test phases of the project.
