## Evolution:

### Process management:

The process management that this work implied left us with a series of artifacts.
The first artifact is the [agregaaaaaaaaar contribution metric](fff), this allows us to realize that we actually do a collaborative work, since there are activities in which was involved all the team, this don't reduce agility, but, made us achieve the activities on the set time, also are activities that we did individually, every activity has a score assigned previously agreed with the team, so everyone was agree with the score, which allowed the realization of a just work, resulting in all had the same score.

A tool that we use to organize ourselves was [Trello](https://trello.com/b/JzEzsDt0/our-project-fis), in which we can observe those responsible for assigned each task to them, as well as the delivery deadline, worth mentioning that in the Trello can also find activities that we did as a team witch aren't accurately from this project, but yes from the rest of the class, this is important to mention it as allows us to visualize that each activity was previously design and was a monitoring to secure the developing of each activities required.
  
The last artifact of the management of the process was the [binacle from this second part](Binnacle/binnacle2.md), its importance is that thanks to this we could have the control and report of what was done during the weak, here we can observe the agreements we reached, and what we did before, during and after each meeting.

### Correspondence with the Requirements:

After reworking the requirements, the user stories, and establishing the acceptance criteria, we considered that they were specific enough and we could start carrying out the implementation of the product.

1. Choose a soft-skill:

After the first welcome menu, the first thing that follows is the skills catalog, where the user can select the desired soft-skill to train.

2. Progress recognition:

In the acceptance criteria of this requirement, we had established that each activity had to have a checkbox to be marked by the user, and when they moved between menus its status would remain intact, that is, whether they were already completed or not.

3. Completed content:

After selecting the skill, a menu is presented where a vertical list of activities is presented and the user can access the one they want, even if they have already completed it. In the acceptance criteria for this, we established that the list of activities will always be the same, that is, they will be presented in the same order.

4. Soft-skills categorization:

Related to the first requirement of how we structure the content by skill and from there by activity. Likewise, in the acceptance criteria of this we include that the interface must be accompanied by a representative illustration of the skill.

5. Progress saving:

Each activity presents different objectives that the user must achieve, when this moment arrives the user marks it as completed in the upper right corner, in the same way it can be pressed again, and it will be unmarked. When navigating to other activities or menus, the app recognizes our progress, this is also true if we completely exit the app and we go back in, since the progress is stored in the device local storage.

### Lessons learned:
We´ve learned several lessons throughout the Fundamentals of Software Engineering course, related to the organization, planning and development of a project.

During these last months, we found ourselves with the task of developing a team project, which we were trying to develop professionally. We learned to work as a team, to communicate in a good way, as well as we learned the strengths and weaknesses of our team, which helped us speed up the preparation of our project. And speaking of speeding up, a lesson we learned during the course was how to work with an agile methodology, as well as the different software life cycle models we could work with.

As expected from a subject about the fundamentals of SI, we learned a lot about theory, but what was most enriching was the fact that we had to go beyond learning theory, and applied the knowledge seen in class for the Development of the project.

A lesson that everyone should learn is communication, especially when we work as a team. Therefore, as a team, we recommend that if you get to work as a team, do not be afraid to ask if something is not clear or if you want to contribute something to the team, each opinion counts and contributes too much so that everyone can communicate correctly.

Without a doubt, we learned very valuable lessons that will be of great help to us in the not too distant future and will make us more effective when dealing with any problem that may arise.
