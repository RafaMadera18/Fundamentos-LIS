### Description:

The product’s main objective is to help the user to train and polish the softskills they might need due to their line of work. Having as well, the opportunity to check on other softskills that could be useful for them at some point. The user will train the softskills they selected, by completing certain activities, such as riddles and exercises, as well as watching videos related to the softskill they´re training. 

The project´s reach we have in mind, is based on the assistance we are providing to the user, by helping them develop new softskills or train and polish the ones they already have knowledge of. Besides that, since the project will initially be focusing on English language speakers, the reach will be larger, than starting with the project being on Spanish, and it will also increase the number of potential users we might have in the future.

At the moment, we will be focusing only on two softskills, to begin with, since there are plenty of available softskills we could use, and it would take us a long time to finish the project, time we don’t really have. So, time will be our main limitation while developing the project.


### Users:

We are focused on helping all kind of people who want to learn or improve their softskills. Our main users are students from various 
semesters that want to have a complete scholar education by learning skills they will use in their day to day worklife. 


- Primary 
Students of higher semesters of university.

- Secondary 
Students of the firsts semesters of university 

- Potential 
All kind of people who wants to learn about softskills.



### Innovation:

There are lots of apps focused on softskills, but the only thing they focus on is explaining what softskills are and none of them teach you how to develop them, unlike our project Ad Astra. 

The difference between Ad Astra and other apps is that in our project you can learn through videos, information and different activities.

### Process description:
<img src="/Assets/scrum.jpg" width="600" height="300"/>


We adopted the SCRUM methodology for the development of our project. 

[Scrum roles](/Scrum%20roles/README.md)


To start the project, we first defined the “Product backlog”, meaning we made a list of ideas, necessities, etc. which we discussed in a “Sprint planning meeting” where we stablished our “Sprint backlog” which is the group of requirements needed to build a set part of the project in a certain time span (Usually, 4 weeks according to the SCRUM methodology)

Another important part of SCRUM we adopted is the “Daily scrum” which are daily meetings to solve any organizational issues and get up to date on the work being done. The only difference being we hold the meetings only twice a week (one with the teacher and one without him). To speed up the process we write down on a binnacle the previously done activities, the problems that came up and what we plan on working on next.

Finally, we also use a Trello board in which we define and assign the specific activities for every team member, this way everyone can easily check the development status and their assigned tasks at any moment.

### Process managment:

The process management that this work implied left us with a series of artifacts. As we had mentioned, a tool that we should use to organize ourselves was [trello](https://trello.com/b/JzEzsDt0/our-project-fis), a tool in which we can observe those responsible for assigned each task to them, as well as the delivery deadline, while GitHub helped us to monitor that each member complies with their part of the work, since with the GitHub branches we can observe that each member contributed an essential part to the project, in addition, with this document we can observe the values given to each activity, values obtained in the most objective way possible, that is, with an agreement between the entire team.

It is worth mentioning that another artifact left by the process was the [binacle](/Binnacle/README.md), which can be found in this GitHub (include link), in it we can observe the agreements we reached, and what we did before, during and after each meeting.

### Generic skills:

* #### Communicates in Spanish orally and in writing in his professional interventions and his personal life using the language correctly:

We obtained this competence cause at the moment of writing the functional and non-functional requirements, the description of the product and the process, the meetings with our teamwork and the teacher, etc. Among this and other activities, we had to learn how to express ourselves clearly and concisely to avoid misunderstandings and made others understand what we want to communicate. 

* #### Uses ICT in their professional interventions and in their personal life in a pertinent and responsible manner:

We use Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) at every time of the product development process, from using different types of programs to capture our ideas, making the slides of the presentation, communicating with the teamwork, etc. For example, we used Trello to be able to organize ourselves and divide the respective tasks, also we use GitHub where we could store the repository, and those were just some examples of all the technological tools that we use in our day-to-day to get the job done.

### Disciplinary skills:

* #### Analyze the disciplinary evolution of Software Engineering, as well as the characteristics of the professional linked to it, according to the theoretical framework and the curricular models of the discipline:

We obtained this competence through the talks we had as a team to carry out activities, such as the ANIEI vs. UADY comparisons, where we analyzed and compared the areas of knowledge and the subjects found in the curriculum of the software engineering degree. In the same way, we were able to observe and question the disciplinary evolution, and the skills of software engineering through other documents, such as that of the IEEE.

* #### Analyze the main methods, techniques, procedures and good practices used in the software requirements, design, coding, testing and maintenance phases, in accordance with the body of knowledge recognized by the discipline:

This competence was obtained during the development of the project, specifically with the decision to adopt the SCRUM methodology, since thanks to the fact that we chose this methodology, we were able to analyze the way in which we were going to develop the project, thus having a better idea of the methods to use, the procedures and the techniques that we will need to carry out.
