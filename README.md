New Challenges and problems always arise in the field of work and if we don't have the necessary softskills we will not be able to do a good job either when communicating with our colleagues or when we trying to find a quick solution, even solving problems beatween our teams.


These softskills have to start working from an early age to be polished un adulthood, For that arises the idea of Ad AstraðŸ’« an aplication that will help you train the most important softskills in the industry, based on riddles and exercises that alow you to learn certain softskills.
