### Description:

The product’s main objective is to help the user to train and polish the softskills they might need due to their line of work. Having as well, the opportunity to check on other softskills that could be useful for them at some point. The user will train the softskills they selected, by completing certain activities, such as riddles and exercises, as well as watching videos related to the softskill they´re training. 

The project´s reach we have in mind, is based on the assistance we are providing to the user, by helping them develop new softskills or train and polish the ones they already have knowledge of. Besides that, since the project will initially be focusing on English language speakers, the reach will be larger, than starting with the project being on Spanish, and it will also increase the number of potential users we might have in the future.

At the moment, we will be focusing only on two softskills, to begin with, since there are plenty of available softskills we could use, and it would take us a long time to finish the project, time we don’t really have. So, time will be our main limitation while developing the project.


### Users:

We are focused on helping all kind of people who want to learn or improve their softskills. Our main users are students from various 
semesters that want to have a complete scholar education by learning skills they will use in their day to day worklife. 


- Primary 
Students of higher semesters of university.

- Secondary 
Students of the firsts semesters of university 

- Potential 
All kind of people who wants to learn about softskills.



### Innovation:

There are lots of apps focused on softskills, but the only thing they focus on is explaining what softskills are and none of them teach you how to develop them, unlike our project Ad Astra. 

The difference between Ad Astra and other apps is that in our project you can learn through videos, information and different activities.

We adopted the SCRUM methodology for the development of our project. This methodology is based on assigning a “Scrum master”, who is the person in charge of managing the time and resources available for the project, and a “Development team”, which is the group of people managed by the Scrum master to develop the product. 
In our case, the “Scrum master” would be Russel Bonilla Pech, and the “Development team” the rest of the group.

An important characteristic of this methodology is the fact that even though there are roles assigned, it allows for change and variations on the functions performed by the team members if the project requires it.

The scrum methodology also allows for a role called “Product owner”. He works with the primary users and the scrum team to make sure the final product is aligned with the requirements and the commercial objectives. Since our project doesn’t have commercial objectives, the role of the “Product owner” isn’t clearly defined, however, the role teacher Edgar Cambranes fulfills, is very similar, because he corrects the mistakes and advises the team on how to better achieve the set objectives.

To start the project, we first defined the “Product backlog”, meaning we made a list of ideas, necessities, etc. which we discussed in a “Sprint planning meeting” where we stablished our “Sprint backlog” which is the group of requirements needed to build a set part of the project in a certain time span (Usually, 4 weeks according to the SCRUM methodology)

Another important part of SCRUM we adopted is the “Daily scrum” which are daily meetings to solve any organizational issues and get up to date on the work being done. The only difference being we hold the meetings only twice a week (one with the teacher and one without him). To speed up the process we write down on a binnacle the previously done activities, the problems that came up and what we plan on working on next.

Finally, we also use a Trello board in which we define and assign the specific activities for every team member, this way everyone can easily check the development status and their assigned tasks at any moment.

### Process managment:

The process management that this work implied left us with a series of artifacts. As we had mentioned, a tool that we should use to organize ourselves was [trello](https://trello.com/b/JzEzsDt0/our-project-fis), a tool in which we can observe those responsible for assigned each task to them, as well as the delivery deadline, while GitHub helped us to monitor that each member complies with their part of the work, since with the GitHub branches we can observe that each member contributed an essential part to the project, in addition, with this document we can observe the values given to each activity, values obtained in the most objective way possible, that is, with an agreement between the entire team.

It is worth mentioning that another artifact left by the process was the [binacle](https://github.com/RaptorRush135/Fundamentos-LIS/blob/be0bb073da4b7da8471fb930e4d78dee0f1248bf/Binnacle/README.md), which can be found in this GitHub (include link), in it we can observe the agreements we reached, and what we did before, during and after each meeting.
