### Description:

The product’s main objective is to help the user to train and polish the softskills they might need due to their line of work. Having as well, the opportunity to check on other softskills that could be useful for them at some point. The user will train the softskills they selected, by completing certain activities, such as riddles and exercises, as well as watching videos related to the softskill they´re training. 

The project´s reach we have in mind, is based on the assistance we are providing to the user, by helping them develop new softskills or train and polish the ones they already have knowledge of. Besides that, since the project will initially be focusing on English language speakers, the reach will be larger, than starting with the project being on Spanish, and it will also increase the number of potential users we might have in the future.

At the moment, we will be focusing only on two softskills, to begin with, since there are plenty of available softskills we could use, and it would take us a long time to finish the project, time we don’t really have. So, time will be our main limitation while developing the project.


### Users:

We are focused on helping all kind of peolple who wants to learn or improve their softskills. Our main users are student from various 
semesters that want to have a complete scolar education cause since they will need it in their day to day. 


-Primary 
Students of higher semesters of university.

-Secondary 
Students of the firsts semesters of university 

-Potential 
All kind of people who wants to learn about softskills.



### Innovation:

There are lots of apps focused on softskills, but the only thing they focused on is explaining what softskills are
and none of them teaches you how to developed them, unlike our project Ad Astra. 

The diference between Ad Astra and other apps is that in our project you can learn through videos, 
information and different activities.
