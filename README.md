### Product evolution:

In this second delivery, we focused on designing the product, but before building the wireframe we had to restructure and refine the requirements to continue with the following steps. Later on, having our products´ wireframe, the next we needed to do was make it into a medium-fidelity prototype, in which we added the different available soft skills with their respective activities.
Finally, we did a test with different users to check out how they interact with the prototype and to know if we had something to change about the interface or the wording of the activities.

### Requeriments:

#### Requeriments evolution:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

Puedes hacer una comparación entre los requerimientos así cóm justificar el motivo de cambio, (por cuestiones de tiempo, porque elegimos los más esenciales, etc...)

#### Refinement of artifacts:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

podemos dar una breve explicación de los cambios, por ejemplo, no utilizamos los diagramas de casos de uso e hicimos algunos cambios en las h. de usuario de acuerdo a nuestros requerimientos.....

### Process managment:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

me voy a apoyar de esto, pero agregaré cambios significativos
The process management that this work implied left us with a series of artifacts. As we had mentioned, a tool that we should use to organize ourselves was [trello](https://trello.com/b/JzEzsDt0/our-project-fis), a tool in which we can observe those responsible for assigned each task to them, as well as the delivery deadline, while GitHub helped us to monitor that each member complies with their part of the work, since with the GitHub branches we can observe that each member contributed an essential part to the project, in addition, with this document we can observe the values given to each activity, values obtained in the most objective way possible, that is, with an agreement between the entire team.

It is worth mentioning that another artifact left by the process was the [binacle](/Binnacle/README.md), which can be found in this GitHub (include link), in it we can observe the agreements we reached, and what we did before, during and after each meeting.

### Design:

#### Prototypes:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

agregar prototipos, recomendación, agregar las capturas en un md dentro de una carpeta y poner el link


aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

#### ¿corresponde con los requerimientos? ¿por qué?:

For the design of the product, we have some requirements which are reflected in the creation of the prototype. First, any user after entering the application can choose between any available soft skills they wish to develop, in this case, we have two: creativity and decision-making. And when they choose one of the soft skills, the list of activities for each skill will appear.
Our next requirement is recognition of progress. Each time the user completes an activity, they can mark the task as completed in the box that appears at the top right of the screen, so they can know which activities have already been done and which remain to be completed. Moving on to the next point, once the activity is finished, the user can review the activity and its content again using the arrows located at the bottom of the screen or return to the list of all activities and select the one they want to review.


#### validación de las interfaces con el cliente / usuarios:

### Our presentation video (delivery 2):


### Generic skills:
#### -Communicates in Spanish orally and in writing in his professional interventions and his personal life using the language correctly
Communication is extremely important in our day-to-day and we obtained this competence while restructuring and refining the requirements, also in the meetings between the development team and the scrum master, as well while creating the work material for the soft skills, since in each of these activities we had to express ourselves clearly and concisely to avoid misunderstandings and make others understand what we want to communicate.
#### -Uses ICT in their professional interventions and their personal life in a pertinent and responsible manner
For this second delivery, we continue using Trello to be able to organize ourselves and assign tasks, Github to store the information in our repository, and Teams to hold meetings and discuss what we should do next.
But unlike the last installment, we learned to use Figma to be able to translate our wireframe into a medium-fidelity prototype.
#### -Make decisions in your professional and personal practice, responsibly.
We had an organized list of activities so that we could be prepared and move forward using our developed skills. As a team, we decided to prioritize the design and test phases of the project.

### Disciplinary skills:

  •	**Select the Software Life Cycle Model at the beginning of a project, based on the characteristics of the development team, the client, and the problem.**

This competence was obtained no long after the first delivery of the project, after we analyzed and compared the different life cycle models, we went on and selected the prototype model. This model was the one we considered to be the most suitable for our project, since it´s currently being developed as a mobile application, working with prototypes will benefit the development team, as well as the client.

We also had to prepare an exposition about the prototype model, including and example of how it was used during the development of a project. Doing this helped us to better understand the model we choose and made us realize that it was the model that would best suit our project.
