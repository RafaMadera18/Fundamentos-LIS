| **Week** | **Previously done activities** | **Problems that came up** | **what we plan to do** |
|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 28 sep - 4 oct | We discussed the project proposals we had uploaded to our GitHub and reduced them to two options (Soft Skills development and help choosing non-compulsory subjects), we agreed to debate about the relevancy of the problematics we would be tackling and the feasibility of making a project that solves it in the time span we have available to do so. This was with the objective of being able to choose which one of the two problematics we are going to work on.| We needed to choose beetwen our two project proposals and to find good arguments to justify our decision | We plan that in the next meeting we can justifu our chosen project with arguments, for that we will work on investigation points in favor during the week|
| 5 oct - 11 oct | We are goiwork on.   | Although everything went well in this meeting, a problem arose when the professor asked us for our functional requirements, since we were so focused on the arguments to defend the project, that we did not work on the project requirements. |We are going to work in the functional and non-functional requirements |
| 12 oct - 18 oct | In the previous meeting we did not have our functional requirements, during the week the team met to work on both the functional and non-functional requirements   | The main problem was that due to work reasons the teacher could not attend the meeting (12 octuber), however, despite that, the team met to discuss issues such as the score of each activity, and what we could improve for the next installment of the project. .
We had feedback that will help us improve. |We plan to work as quickly as possible to comply with all the issues in the rubric, this is why we want to have a good first installment of the project, we also plan to work on the video about the scrum methodology |
