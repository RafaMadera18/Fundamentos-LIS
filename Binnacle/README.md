| 28 sep - 4 oct | We discussed the project proposals we had uploaded to our GitHub and reduced them to two options (Soft Skills development and help choosing non-compulsory subjects), we agreed to debate about the relevancy of the problematics we would be tackling and the feasibility of making a project that solves it in the time span we have available to do so. This was with the objective of being able to choose which one of the two problematics we are going to work on.   | Considering the received feedback we discussed and finally agreed to work in Ad Astra; but we didnâ€™t establish the functional requirements yet. We held a meeting on Sunday to agree on our process of work and organization, then agreed on the methodology we will use to measure the percentage of collaboration by the team members. Also, we created the different GitHub branches, and finally, established the method by which we will make the binnacles and collaborations to the project. |
