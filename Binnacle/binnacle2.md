| **Week** | **Previously done activities** | **Problems that came up** | **What we plan to do** |
|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 18 oct - 21 oct | We finished the first installment, but some aspects still needed to be fine-tuned | Problems were detected in our requirements and our teacher gave us some advice for improvement | We planned to correct the functional requirements and their respective artifacts |
| 21 oct - 27 oct | We worked on the requirements and artifacts taking into account the recommendations made by the teacher | Apparently no problems were detected, so we could move on to the next stage. | We planned to work with figma for the creation of a prototype taking into account our requirements / user stories / acceptance criteria |
| 27 oct - 03 nov | We started doing Sprints that allowed us to start with the first “prototype” | The "prototype" did not yet have the necessary content to identify the project idea. | We planned to work on the content of the project, we will focus on the soft-skill of creativity and decision-making. |
| 03 nov - 10 nov | We did too much research until we got to the creation of our activities, that is, we created the content of our prototype | We didn't have any problems, we just needed to have contact with the users. | We planned to get valuable feedback from users.|
| 10 nov - 17 nov | We had contact with the users and got feedback on the things that worked and the things that could be improved. | We had no problems, we just got improvement feedback that we used to finish the prototype | Since we basically had the product ready, we planned to have a meeting with the team to identify what we could work on, like the development of the product, the UI implementation, etc.
We also planned to modify the spanglish on the app, to have a more professional app.
